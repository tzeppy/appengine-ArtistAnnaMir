The content of my work always touches one way or the other on Taoistic concept of perpetual transformation. My technique, developed over  years of experimentation, is an attempt to reproduce the deeply spiritual effect of light on icons' golden rizas or golden mosaic backgrounds. Any change in the viewer's position modifies dramatically the way the filigreed metal, or uneven bits of mosaic, reflect light. It alters the emotional impact of the art work, just like the movement of the sun in nature shifts the mood of a landscape.
