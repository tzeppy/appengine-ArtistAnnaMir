Nothing embodies the spirit of change more than a wide water surface that reflects a setting sun or a rising full moon. The subject seems a cliche but only if one wants it to be so. If we open ourselves to sublime instead of mundane and focus on subtle rather than general, the reward is a profound experience that is never the same. My waterscapes are a subset of the series "The Journey Through the Dawn and dusk".
