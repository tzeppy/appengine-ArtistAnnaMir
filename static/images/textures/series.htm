I use heavy texture and metallic paints, creating images that change with the change of  light around them and the shift of the viewing point. A metallic background that appears much lighter than the rest of the image can become the darkest part of the painting etc. As a result my paintings convey an array of emotional states that exist in a perpetual state of adjustment, dramatic or subtle, harmonized with their environment.
