I don't play golf, but I find myself captivated by the contrast of textures and the interplay between the golf courses' organic forms and their surroundings.
The mystery and intrigue of it all, especially when a course is empty and lit up by the low sun or a full moon, inspired the creation of a series of golf courses' portraits, a subset of the series "The Journey Through the Dawn and dusk".
