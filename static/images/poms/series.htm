The pomegranate has been used throughout history as a symbol of humanity's most fundamental beliefs and desires, including life and death, rebirth and eternal life, fertility and marriage, abundance and prosperity.<p>
Every aspect of the pomegranate has come to symbolize something ... its shape, color, seeds, juice.<p>
In this series I saw pomegranate as the reason for the annual change of seasons (Persephone and Hades story), so the series is a meditation on winter, a subset of the series "Texture of Light".
